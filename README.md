## Project Description

**HealthyMeal** is an MVP application designed to solve the time-consuming problem of customizing culinary recipes to individual dietary needs. The application uses Artificial Intelligence to generate and modify recipes based on user-defined preferences, such as favorite ingredients, disliked products, and allergens.

### Core Features
- **AI Recipe Generation**: Creates personalized meal suggestions based on user preferences.
- **Preference Profile**: Allows users to define their likes, dislikes, and allergens for tailored results.
- **Recipe Management (CRUD)**: Enables users to save, view, edit, and delete both AI-generated and manually added recipes.
- **User Authentication**: Simple and secure authentication system using email and password.

## Tech Stack
